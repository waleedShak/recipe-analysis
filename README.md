## Introduction
In the advent of our fast-paced modern society and heavily processed food, the average person's diet has deteriorated significantly, leading to a plethora of diseases and health issues. Subsequently, it has become more important than ever for people to be conscious of what they eat and whether or not itâ€™s healthy. This leads to an important question: **Are recipes becoming healthier over time?** To answer this question, I will use two datasets collected from https://www.food.com/: `recipes` which contains unique recipes and `interactions` which contains user reviews of recipes.

`recipes` contains 83,782 rows and 12 columns where each row corresponds to a unique recipe.

| Column             | Description |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------|
| `'name'`           | Name of the recipe|

| `'steps'`          | Recipe steps in order|
| `'description'`    | Recipe description |
| `'ingredients'`    | Recipe Ingredients |
| `'n_ingredients'`  | Ingredient number |

`interactions` contains 731,927 rows and 5 columns where each row corresponds to a user review of a recipe.
